        // constant : this says that the function should return a data and it does not modify the contracts data
        // pure: Function will not read or even change the contracts data
        // payable : this is to declare a function when the user try to use this function and send ether along


        // returns are only going to be used where functions are marked as constants or view



// 0: string: This is Shakti Santosh Nayak
// Here 0 says that this is the first value returned

// In order to change anything on the blockchain we need to submit a transaction

// Basically whenever you want to modify a data in blockchain then you need to make a transaction and 
// and thus you have to pay some fees for getting it to be mined and update the data

// so basically while using the setmessage function we need to make a transaction because we are changing the data
// and while using the simple getmessage function we don't need to make a transaction because we are not changing any data
// and also getmessage function gets executed instantly
// and setmessage function will take time as we are making a transaction and transaction needs to be verified

// Why do we don't return value from a function making a transaction
// Because that function is not going to be instaneous and whenever transaction happens it returns a transaction hash
// Though solidity won't raise error while returning a value from such functions but we should not do it 
// because it returns a transaction hash for the particular transaction and it is not instantaneous


// As remix is running on local test network so the transaction happens very instantly but in real life
// the transaction takes around 15 to 20 seconds
// But in Rinkby test network the block time is around 15 to 20 seconds and thus we will feel the real time for the execution of a transaction

// Gas price means how much wei we can pay for each gas
// If Gas price is set as 10 and gas is 5 then you have to pay 50 wei to complete the transaction

// startGas/Gaslimit measures how much gas is required for this transaction
