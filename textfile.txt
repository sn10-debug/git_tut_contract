This is the git supported project
.git is the hidden folder and this stores the history of all the changes and new things added to the project. ‘.’ Represents that it is a hidden folder

Git status tells that this are the things which are currently present but it is not present in the history of the project

Git restore –staged filename is used to remove a file from the staging area
In staging area the changes are stored in the history but in the commit the changes are saved with the timestamp

If we want to delete a commit number 2 in the sequence then just write git restore hash address of the commit under commit number 2 but be aware that all the commits above commit 2 will be deleted.(Including Commit number 2)


If we have added something to the staging but we don’t want to make it’s commit then we simply stash it that is write the command git stash and if we again want to get that changes in the staging section then we simply write git stash pop 

To clear the stash that is putting the stagged files separately can be done using the command 'git stash clear'

git remote add origin https://github.com/sn10-debug/Inbox-contract.git

This above command is to add the url
Remote means something with respect to url and add means adding something and origin is the name of the url
Usually we give name 'origin' to our personal urls 


git push origin <branch name>

This command will add the particular branch to the origin


Fork in github means that particular code which we cannot make changes direclty can be added to our Directory so that we can make changes

git clone <file link>

This will create the clone of the file in local machine
